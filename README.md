# linkedin2username
OSINT Tool: Generate username lists from companies on LinkedIn.

This is a pure web-scraper, no API key required. You use your valid LinkedIn username and password to login, it will create several lists of possible username formats for all employees of a company you point it at.

Use an account with a lot of connections, otherwise you'll get crappy results. Adding a couple connections at the target company should help - this tool will work up to third degree connections. Note that [LinkedIn will cap search results](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/129/what-you-get-when-you-search-on-linkedin?lang=en) to 1000 employees max.

Here's what you get:
- first.last.txt: Usernames like Joe.Schmoe
- flast.txt:      Usernames like JSchmoe
- firstl.txt:     Usernames like JoeS
- first.txt       Usernames like Joe
- rawnames.txt:   Full name like Joe Schmoe

Optionally, the tool will append @domain.xxx to the usernames.

# Example
You'll need to provide the tool with LinkedIn's company name. You can find that by looking at the URL for the company's page. It should look something like `https://linkedin.com/company/uber-com`. It may or may not be as simple as the exact name of the company.

Here's an example to pull all employees of Uber:
```
$ python linkedin2username.py myname@email.com uber-com
```

Here's an example to pull a shorter list and append the domain name @uber.com to them:
```
$ python linkedin2username.py myname@email.com uber-com -d 5 -n 'uber.com'
```

# Toubleshooting
Sometimes LinkedIn does weird stuff or returns weird results. Sometimes it doesn't like you logging in from new locations. If something looks off, run the tool once or twice more. If it still isn't working, please open an issue.
